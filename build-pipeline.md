# DevOps Assigment 2 - GitHub Actions & DockerHub

## Description of Workflow
In the workflow, first the gradle is built, then the JAR file is copied and renamed to `app.jar`. The JAR and Dockerfile are now both used together to build the Docker image and push it to DockerHub. It is finally pushed after the DockerHub creditentals are checked.
